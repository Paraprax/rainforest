# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  product1 = Product.create(name: 'Box', description: 'Awesome', price_in_cents: 99)
